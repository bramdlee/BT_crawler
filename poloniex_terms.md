TERMS OF USE

Last Revised: August 8, 2015

By accessing or using the  Poloniex  website located at https:// poloniex .com (the “Site”) and any services made available through the Site (collectively, the “Services”), you (“User”) agree to be bound by these  Terms  of Use (“Terms”). The Services are owned and controlled by  Poloniex , Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ Poloniex ”), and the  terms  “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to  Poloniex , Inc. These  Terms  affect your legal rights and obligations. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, do not access or use the Services.

 Poloniex  reserves the right to change or modify the  terms  and conditions contained in these Terms, including but not limited to any policy or guideline of the Site, at any time and at its sole discretion. We will provide notice of these changes by posting the revised  Terms  to the Site and changing the "Last Revised" date at the top of the  Terms , or by emailing users at their provided email addresses, or by any other means as determined by  Poloniex . The decision of which notification chosen will be left to  Poloniex's  sole discretion. Using a particular form of notice in some instances does not obligate us to use the same form in other instances. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions to the Site or at the instant that  Poloniex  transmits the information to the users (e.g. via email). These changes will apply at that instant to all then current and subsequent uses of the Site. You waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Your continued use of this Site acts as acceptance of such changes or modifications. If you do not agree to the Terms in effect when you access or use the Site, you must stop using the Site.

PREAMBLE
 Poloniex  provides an online tool (the “Platform”) that allows users to freely trade between a number of different virtual currencies (“Cryptocurrency”).

1. ELIGIBILITY
By accessing or using the Site, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and have not previously been suspended or removed from the Site. You also represent and warrant that you are not a resident of the State of New York. You represent and warrant that you are not: (a) located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or services, (b) identified as a "Specially Designated National", or (c) placed on the Commerce Department's Denied Persons List. You further represent and warrant that you will not use the Site if the laws of your country prohibit you from doing so in accordance with these Terms. Finally, you represent and warrant that you will not be using this site for any illegal activity, including but not limited to money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

2. REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT
In order to access and use the Services, you must create an account with  Poloniex  (an “Account”). You agree to: (a) provide accurate, current and complete information when creating the account; (b) maintain and promptly update your Account information to keep it accurate, complete, and current; (c) maintain the security and confidentiality of your login credentials and restrict access to your Account and your computer; (d) promptly notify  Poloniex  if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Site; and (e) take responsibility for all activities that occur under your Account and accept all risks of unauthorized access.

3. PRIVACY POLICY
Your privacy is important to us. We only share your information with third parties as outlined in our Privacy Policy or required to do so by law enforcement, court order, or in compliance with legal reporting obligations.

4. CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET
The transmission of data or information (including communications by e-mail) over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks is not one hundred percent secure, and is subject to possible loss, interception, or alteration while in transit. Accordingly,  Poloniex  does not assume any liability, without limitation, for any damage you may experience or costs you may incur as a result of any transmissions over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks, including but not limited to transmissions involving the Platform or e-mail with  Poloniex  containing your personal information. While  Poloniex  will take commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide to  Poloniex  and will treat such information in accordance with  Poloniex's  Privacy Policy, in no event will the information you provide to  Poloniex  be deemed to be confidential, create any fiduciary obligations for  Poloniex , or result in any liability for  Poloniex  in the event that such information is negligently released by  Poloniex  or accessed by third parties without  Poloniex's  consent.

5.  POLONIEX  DOES NOT PROVIDE INVESTING ADVICE
We are an execution-only service and do not advise on the merits of any particular transactions or their taxation consequences. In entering into any transaction on the Platform, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of the transaction. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction. We give you no warranty as to the suitability of the cryptocurrencies traded under these Terms and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you.
If at any point  Poloniex  or its representatives do provide trading recommendations, market commentary, or any other information, the act of doing so is incidental to your relationship with us and imposes no obligation of truth or due diligence on behalf of  Poloniex  or its representatives. We give no representation, warranty, or guarantee as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information or as to the tax consequences of any transaction.

6. MARGIN TRADING
Margin trading on  Poloniex  is HIGH RISK. You may sustain a total loss of funds, or owe money beyond what you have deposited to your Account. The high volatility and substantial risk of illiquidity in markets means that you may not always be able to liquidate your position.
If the value of the assets in your Account falls below the maintenance margin requirement or  Poloniex  determines, at its sole discretion, that your Account appears to be in danger of defaulting on a loan,  Poloniex  may seize and liquidate any or all of your positions and assets on any balance in your Account in order to settle your debt to lenders. If, after your positions and assets are liquidated, your account still contains insufficient funds to settle your debts to lenders, you will be responsible for any additional funds owed. Intentionally defaulting on a loan may result in  Poloniex  reporting your activities to authorities and/or in legal prosecution.
Although  Poloniex  takes several precautions to prevent a user from defaulting on a loan, the high volatility and substantial risk of illiquidity in markets means that  Poloniex  cannot make any guarantees against default. When you lend to other users using the Platform’s P2P lending system, you risk the loss of an unpaid principle if the borrower defaults on a loan and liquidation of the borrower's account fails to raise sufficient funds to cover his or her debt.
All trading, margin trading, lending, and/or borrowing is conducted by Users, and  Poloniex  does not take any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of any services  Poloniex  provides or your failure to understand the risks involved in your use of such services.

This may affect your ability to withdraw funds in your account and you indemnify  Poloniex  against any losses associated with an inability to deposit and/or withdraw funds based on your verification level.
